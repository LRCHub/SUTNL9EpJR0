They're comin' up deep Comin' up deep
What you wanna roll me for
You'll never shake me Never shake me
Ah! Ah!
Here comin' another one
Tryin' to give me a hug
Never gonna hold you
You think you caught me You caught me
You caught me
I'm not dreamin'
I don't sleep at all
I'm not braver (?) then
There's no hand to hold
We've got no worries and we're out of control This must be the place
You love to hate the ones you can leave alone
This must be the place
This must be the place (This must be)
This must be the place (This must be)
They're comin' up deep Comin' up deep
How you're gonna take me up
You'll never shake me Never shake me
Ah! Ah!
Here comin' another one Gonna get you some Now you gotta know You'll never stop me
Stop me Stop - me
??? nothing
There's no god to call
I'm just fallin' in
???
This must be the place
This must be the place
This must be the place
You love to hate the ones you can leave alone This must be the place
This must be the place (This must be)
This must be the place (This must be)
This must be the place
This must be the place
