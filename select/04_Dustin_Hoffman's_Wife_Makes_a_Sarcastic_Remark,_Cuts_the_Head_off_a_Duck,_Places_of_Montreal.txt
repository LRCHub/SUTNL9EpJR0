The man in the bathroom keeps on taking my photograph
While telling me that bugs don't like music
I trained them all to answer my telephone
But he always runs when I try to plug him in

I watched a pink lady attacking an elephant
And she's got a soldier on a paper
He shoots me when I'm in my underwear
I can't sleep because he always wants to talk
